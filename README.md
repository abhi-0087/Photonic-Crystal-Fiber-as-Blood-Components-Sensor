# Photonic-Crystal-Fiber-as-Blood-Components-Sensor

* Developed a novel sensor using photonic crystal fiber (PCF) for detecting blood components such as red blood cells, hemoglobin, white blood cells, plasma, and water.
* Conducted comprehensive numerical simulations and design optimization using RSOFT FEMSIM to enhance sensor performance.
* Achieved high sensitivity and selectivity by leveraging the unique optical properties of PCFs.
* Demonstrated potential applications in medical diagnostics and biomedical research.
